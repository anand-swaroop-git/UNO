WIP

Create a high level architecture diagram.
Create S3 manually/awscli to store Terraform state.
Create platform folder and initialize Terraform so that it stores its state in S3.
Create relevant variable and platform files for Terraform to create DynamoDB
Make sure app runs with flask on local.
Make sure app runs with flask on containers.
    Needs .env file for AWS environment variables.
    Insert variable placeholders in docker-compose.yml which will consume the values from .env file
Push images to docker hub.
Rename docker-compose.yml to docker-compose.yml.dev and create another docker-compose.yml plus remove the build process since we will now pull images from docker hub.
Create AWS ECR repository manually/awscli
Docker login command from ECR console to give AWS access to docker login.
    Tag all the images again and push it to AWS ECR repository
Create EKS (or ECS?) cluster with Terraform following this link - 
    ECS using Fargate
        While creating container definition, we can add private repository auth (When true, private registry authentication is enabled using AWS Secrets Manager.)
            Also an option to pass env variables from Systems Manager Parameter Store. Currently passed through env variables in task definition
        While creating service from the wizard, ALB, and two SGs were created, listening for ALB is 5002
